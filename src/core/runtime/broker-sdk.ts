// broker and the pi SDK (`@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`).
//
// crouter has never imported the SDK before — it only ever forked the `pi` binary
// (see `launch.ts buildPiArgv`). The broker (T4) is the first consumer. This shim
// is the one place the dependency is named, so:
//   - the version tripwire (`assertEngineVersion`) lives here, and
//   - the `CRTR_BROKER_ENGINE` test seam (T11) has a single dynamic-import
//     indirection point (`loadBrokerEngine`) to swap in the fake engine.
//
// Nothing else in the tree imports this yet; it compiles but stays inert so the
// lifecycle suite stays green until the broker is wired up.
